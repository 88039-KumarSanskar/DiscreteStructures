Enter the no. of vertices of the Graph : 3
Enter 1 if there is edge between given vertices else enter 0.
(head , tail)
( 0,1 ) : 0
( 0,2 ) : 0
( 1,0 ) : 1
( 1,2 ) : 1
( 2,0 ) : 0
( 2,1 ) : 1

Entered Graph looks like :
In-Degree of 0 = 1
Out-Degree of 0 = 0

In-Degree of 1 = 1
Out-Degree of 1 = 2

In-Degree of 2 = 1
Out-Degree of 2 = 1
